    <Title>About Me</Title>
    <Description>
        <p>I am a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp" target="_blank">full stack</a> .NET software developer, based in Hilton / South Africa and available to work on projects worldwide.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Current interests are <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor" target="_blank">Microsoft Blazor WebAssembly</a> and general <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp" target="_blank">Blockchain</a> development, so when not busy on actual work - I am fiddling with these technologies. I feel there is a massive future for both, and I really want to be part of building that future.</p>

        <p>My techical abilities are rather versatile, but my focus sits in the Microsoft Ecosystem - .NET, C#, SQL Server, etc...</p>
        <br />
        <p>Please see my <a href="/SkillsMatrix">Skills Matrix</a> for a verbose listing of skills I have accumulated over the years.</p>
        <br />
        <p>While Angular, Vue, React, {insert JS framework here} are mainstream SPA frameworks, I prefer to swim upstream and dig into <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor" target="_blank">Blazor</a>. Yep, Microsoft technology. BTW: .NET is open source and runs on any platform.</p>
